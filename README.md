# Wiley QE Internship Training Program - 2024

This repository contains the automation scripts for Assessment 2 of the Wiley QE Internship Training Program. In this assessment, I automated three functional test cases identified in Assessment 1 using Playwright. The goal was to demonstrate automation skills by converting manual test scenarios into automated scripts, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in the testing process. The following are the automated test cases and their descriptions.

## Automated Test Cases:

### Test_001: Account Creation (Register) with Valid Credentials
**Test Description:**  
Verify user can successfully register and create an account.

### Test_004: Search for Publication/Article (e.g., “IEEE 802 Wireless Systems”)
**Test Description:**  
Verify user can search for publications/ articles/ etc


### Test_006: Download Free Publication/Article in PDF Format
**Test Description:**  
Download the “Front Matter” publication in pdf format which is displayed in search results of “ieee 802 wireless systems”.

##
This project demonstrates how to effectively automate functional test cases with TypeScript and Playwright, simplifying the testing process for improved precision and effectiveness along with the key aspects in the Wiley Online Library. 

I am excited to improve my automation testing abilities and am appreciative that I was allowed to try the Wiley QE Internship Training Program.
